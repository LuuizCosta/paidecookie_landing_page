# Landing Page
## This is my first personal project!
### Using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript I was able to create a landing page for my side business (a cookie shop!)


As it's probably still in my GitHub README.md, I am a graduated chef!

After giving up on the kitchen life, I've decided to enroll at 42 to learn how to program, and to make some money to survive,
I've decided to start selling something that I like: **cookies!**

RocketSeat had this thing called Next Level Week, that works much like a basecamp. They had a project for beginners (at the Origin track),
and they taught us how to make landing pages. They had a very specific page, but since the beginning I've set my mind to make it something 
that would make sense for me to use.

Well, here it is! There is still some things that I'd like to change, but Ill be doing this during this month.

Right now there are a few things that I know I need to change and I know how to do it, and a few things that I want to change but I'm not
that sure on how to do it (but I do know it's possible).

If you are around SÃ£o Paulo, look out the website and... order some cookies! Why not, right?
